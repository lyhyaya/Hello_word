# Hello_word

I am going to do research on personalized recommendation. Recently I read some paper, realize the work on personal recommendation  relates to many aspects of theories and knowledge, such as data mining, natural language processing, machine learning and etc. I don't know where to start.


我是一名博一研究室，想要做旅游个性化推荐方面，感觉个性化推荐涉及的知识面非常广，不知从哪里开始，也怀疑会不会有所突破
